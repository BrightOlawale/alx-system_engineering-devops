WHAT IS A SERVER?
A server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM (Virtual Machine) or container.

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A DOMAIN NAME
Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols.

WHAT TYPE OF DNS RECORD “www” IS IN WWW.FOOBAR.COM
www is a sub domain name. The www prefix always leads to the main domain name which is foobar.com.

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE WEB SERVER:
A web server is a software that delivers web pages.

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE APPLICATION SERVER
The application server provides access to the data for the user making the request.

WHAT IS THE DATABASE:
A database stores information that is set up for easy access, management and updating, they collect information on people, places, or things.

EXPLAIN ISSUES SUCH AS SPOF, DOWNTIME, CANNOT SCALE
A single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working.

DOWNTIME:
This refers to the amount of time your server is not turned on and actively working.

CANNOT SCALE:
This system cannot scale out or in because it operates on only a single server, hence cannot scale out when it experiences too much incoming traffic.
